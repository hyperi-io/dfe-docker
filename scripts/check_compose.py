"""Validate that docker-compose.yml resolves, on every path we ship.

`docker compose config` is the instrument: it interpolates every variable, applies
profiles and overlays, and fails on anything structurally wrong. It needs no daemon
and no registry access, which is what makes it usable as a gate.

The obstacle is that the stack deliberately hard-fails on unset image pins
(``${DFE_LOADER_VERSION:?...}``), and those pins come from the DFE stack SSoT --
a private artifact CI has no business pulling just to check YAML. So this script
reads the hard-fail keys straight out of the compose file and supplies a
placeholder for each. That keeps the check hermetic, and it means adding a new
hard-fail key can never quietly break CI: the key is discovered, not listed here.

Placeholders are only ever injected for keys the compose file ITSELF declares
mandatory, and only into this process's subprocess environment. A real value
already present in the environment always wins, so a local run with a pinned .env
validates the real pins.

Note that on a fresh checkout Make will have created a .env before this runs (the
`-include .env` rule in the Makefile), so the two generated secrets resolve for
real and only the image pins get placeholders. That is harmless here -- this checks
compose STRUCTURE, not that any particular digest exists.

Paths checked:

- registry: ``-f docker-compose.yml`` alone, the CI and production path.
- dev: the same plus the auto-loaded ``docker-compose.override.yml``, the path
  ``make dev`` takes.
- live: dev plus ``docker-compose.live.yml``, the path ``make dev LIVE=1``
  takes. Its ``${DFE_SRC_ROOT:?...}`` mounts are hard-fail by design, so the
  placeholder injection covers that key the same way it covers image pins.

Each is checked against both Kafka backends, because the two are mutually
exclusive and a change can easily satisfy one and break the other -- which is
precisely what happened with the topic-init service that ran a Redpanda image on
the Apache profile.

Beyond resolution, one semantic assertion rides along: no service that gates on
``/readyz`` may carry a CPU ceiling under `_MIN_READYZ_CPUS`. See that constant
for why a lower ceiling takes the endpoint dark while the data path keeps working.
